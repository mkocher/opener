What is it?
===========
A set of ruby scripts for opening safari to a given URL at a given time, reloading every few minutes, then closing.

===
We use this at Pivotal Labs for bringing up [whiteboard](https://github.com/mkocher/whiteboard) on our video wall every morning before standup.

Ruby Appscript? Really?
=======================
Yup, works just fine.
